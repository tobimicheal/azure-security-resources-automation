# Azure Security Resources Automation with ARM & Bicep

This project automates the deployment of core security infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles and **Azure DevOps Pipelines**. It includes two key resources:

- üîê **Azure Key Vault** deployed via ARM template
- üõ°Ô∏è **Network Security Group (NSG)** deployed via Bicep

All deployments are triggered through a CI/CD pipeline defined in `azure-pipelines.yml`.

## üöÄ How to Use

> **Note**: You'll need an Azure DevOps project connected to your Azure subscription using a service connection (Managed Identity recommended).

‚úÖ How to Use
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tobimicheal/azure-security-resources-automation
2. Push to Azure Repos or GitHub-Azure DevOps integration
3. Edit the pipeline if needed
   Resource group name: ade-sandbox-rg
   Vault name: You can modify this inside keyvault-arm-template.json (make sure it's globally unique!)
4. Run the pipeline
   It will trigger automatically on changes to the main branch
   Or you can trigger it manually from Azure DevOps


### üì¶ Deployment Output

Once the pipeline completes successfully, you‚Äôll see:

- ‚úÖ A **Key Vault** resource in the specified resource group
- ‚úÖ A **Network Security Group (NSG)** with an SSH rule visible under **‚ÄúInbound security rules‚Äù**
